## Description ##

Whitis Court has a unique story among UTâ€™s fifteen residence halls. In 1999, the university bought two co-ops from a private company, and bought the other four in 2003 in order to transform them into a residence hall. Overall Whitis Court houses 197 students throughout the 6 buildings. Each building has movable furniture and community bathrooms. The dormitory features several large living rooms, community kitchens, a classroom facility and a conference room. The Drag (a major street parallel to campus with many dining and shopping options), the communication school, and Kinsolving Dining Hall are all near Whitis Court.

# Resident Reviews #

> Know what you need. I chose Whitis Court because it's a small community, easy to make friends, and quiet. Other people I know requested transfers from Whitis because they thought nothing was ever going on.

"It was slightly loud, but the location is better than I am right now. In addition with dealing with people, people have to understand that everyone comes from a different background so don't get mad at your roommate(s) if they don't do the same things as you do."

##### Amy, linguistics sophomore #####

"I know all the names of the people I see, and I trust everyone in my dorm. I love that it's small and tight knit. But it's definitely pretty quiet."

##### Nicole, computer science freshman #####
