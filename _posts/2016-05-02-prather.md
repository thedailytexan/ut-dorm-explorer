#Resident Reviews#

> It was nice and quiet.

"Small and quiet community, but NO ELEVATOR! I live on the 4th floor! Moving in was a nightmare!"

#####Sonia, design junior#####

"Really get involved in the community, that's what makes it worth it (and the dorm events frequently have free food)."

#####Sarah, accounting sophomore#####

"It was nice and quiet. On my floor, there were not too many people which I did not mind. However, I did not like it when people just let their doors swing shut. It's so loud." 

#####Piara, nursing sophomore#####
