Prather was built in 1937, making it one of the older dorms on campus. It holds 158 students on four floors with movable furniture and community bathrooms. As part of the Brackenridge-Prather-Roberts trio it shares in an open courtyard space with barbecue pits and tables. Darrell K Royal Memorial Stadium, Gregory Gym and the PCL are all within close proximity to Prather.

##Pros##

> Here's a cool short blockquote that sums up good feelings about San Jacinto.

#####Angelo Cioffi, Computer Science Freshman#####

"It was nice and quiet. On my floor, there were not too many people which I did not mind. However, I did not like it when people just let their doors swing shut. It's so loud." 

#####Piara, nursing Freshman#####

"I loved living in San Jacinto. It was a dorm full of fun and smart people. I made all of my friends there freshman year, and always had people to eat with, watch movies with, go out with, etc. There were always plenty of places to study and hang out with others, and the building is incredibly designed to last for several years. My only dislike is the size of the rooms, but it's part of the college experience."

#####Alena Savera, Architecture Senior#####

"Here's another quote."

##Cons##

> A blockquote from the :( section.

#####Angelo Cioffi, Computer Science Freshman#####

---

"Small and quiet community, but NO ELEVATOR! I live on the 4th floor! Moving in was a nightmare!"

#####Sonia, design sophomore#####

"Great! I just wish the walls were a little thicker, the microwave actually heated up food, the water pressure in the sink was higher, and the dryers actually worked."
