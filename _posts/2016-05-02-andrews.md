#History# 

Andrews stands on the southern end of the honors quad, which is located in the northwest side of campus. It was constructed in 1936, holds 132 students spread out on four floors who share community bathrooms. The coed dormitory boasts numerous amenities including a recreation room, access to two sun decks, easy access to the honors quad, and individual climate control for rooms. The Drag, the communication school, and Kinsolving Dining Hall are all in close proximity to Andrews.

#Student Reviews#

> The honors quad is also just such a nice community and there's so many cool events happening all the time.

"Andrews is super nice. Community style bathrooms have never been an issue because they're always clean, and the room's big enough to not feel cramped. The honors quad is also just such a nice community and there's so many cool events happening all the time. I've made a lot of friends and learned a lot of cool little tidbits of information by sitting in the lobbies and talking to other honors students. It's so interesting to talk to other people and hear what they're interested in. Everyone's so open here."

##### - Mayuri, computer science freshman#####

"Not worth it. Way way way too expensive, enslaved by dine-in dollars, tiny room, thin walls so you can hear your neighbors' sex at all hours. Doors slam, people are inconsiderate, bathrooms are disgusting. Our money is wasted on activities for the socially awkward."

##### - Matthew, English sophomore#####

"The old installments like heavy wood doors and hardwood and the general aesthetic of the dorm was nice, and the ornate study lounges are awesome. However, the community in my dorm and the Honors Quad in general was claustrophobic. I wish someone had told me that the community here is so niche, and I would have picked another dorm. Proximity to Kins Market and the dining hall is great to grab coffee in the morning! It's definitely the best food option on campus. It is also so close to the Drag and the edge of campus that I don't feel shut in or trapped on campus."

##### - Samantha, government sophomore#####

"Loved the community baths, disliked the tiny room. Andrews Lobby to this day is the greatest place on campus."

##### - Gregory, Plan II/chemical engineering junior#####
