Roberts was built in 1936, making it slightly older than its partner, Prather. It holds 127 students on four floors with movable furniture and community bathrooms. As part of the Brackenridge-Prather-Roberts trio it shares in an open courtyard space with barbecue pits and tables. Darrell K Royal Memorial Stadium, Gregory Gym and the PCL are all within close proximity to Roberts.

##Pros##

> Here's a cool short blockquote that sums up good feelings about San Jacinto.

#####Angelo Cioffi, Computer Science Freshman#####

"Really liked how quiet it was. Hated how hard it was to use the kitchen because it was in another building. The front desk was in another building as well, so never had to check in guests or use the front door after midnight." 

#####Jazzlynn, psychology freshman#####

"It was really nice and homey, albeit the lack of individual kitchen is inconvenient."

#####Audrey, chemical engineering freshman#####

"Here's another quote."
