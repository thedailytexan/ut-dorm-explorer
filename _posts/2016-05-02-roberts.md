#Resident Reviews#

> Look at the small dorms! They are cozier and have nice features to them!

"Really liked how quiet it was. Hated how hard it was to use the kitchen because it was in another building. The front desk was in another building as well, so never had to check in guests or use the front door after midnight." 

#####Jazzlynn, psychology sophomore#####

"It was really nice and homey, albeit the lack of individual kitchen is inconvenient."

#####Audrey, chemical engineering sophomore#####

"Look at the small dorms! They are cozier and have nice features to them!"

#####Kourtney, psychology freshman#####
