## Description 

![Moore-Hill Residence Hall](/assets/img/dorms/Dorm_Jester_Area955.jpg)

Moore-Hill was built over a 17 year period from 1939 to 1956. The sprawling coed residence hall spans four floors and houses 386 students. The furniture in each room is built-in, and community bathrooms are spread throughout. It has a 56-inch TV in its lounge and a recreation room. Darrell K Royal Memorial Stadium, Gregory Gym and the PCL are all within close proximity to Moore-Hill.

# Resident Reviews #

> Find a good roommate, and try to get opinions of dorm life from people who have lived in the dorms you are considering. I picked based off online pictures and location, and was completely misled by what I thought my dorm would look like.

"I really loved this dorm. I was very skeptical about it coming in because I never knew about it. But it is a very close, tight-knit group. It's a great place to make friends your freshman year." 

##### Kaitlyn, public health sophomore #####

"Moorehill is a smaller dorm, so it was usually quiet and calm (unlike Jester across the street that constantly had their students evacuating because of pulled fire alarms.) I lived in MH before it was renovated so things are different now. Like the rooms actually have individual thermostats which would have been super nice when I lived there because it was always too hot in the dorm. Also there's only two study lounges. Usually I'd have to go somewhere else to study. The poolside view of Gregory is really nice though."

##### Sherry, journalism senior #####

"Pros for me: Close to class and very central within campus. Small community so you recognize most faces pretty quickly and get to know people. Although most of my friends lived in the quad or west campus, a lot of people who lived in Moore-Hill became friends with people in Moore-Hill. Also really close to both Gregory Gym and the Rec Sports Center. Lots of events early in the year to help you get to know other people living there.
 
 Cons for me: Not close to west campus for weekends. No sinks in any of the rooms. My room was particularly small, though some of my friends rooms were much larger (luck of the draw, I guess). No food in the dorm, though options are right across the street. There is only one study lounge which is nice but also annoying when it is full."

##### Sam, Plan II/Finance junior #####

"The community was kind of weird. Also the bathrooms were pretty dirty. Didn't really make any friends in the dorm, all my friends were from extracurriculars and classes."

##### Ryan, biomedical engineering junior #####

"A girl would run laps up and down our hallway at like 11 pm every other night or so. Also, people had VERY loud sex in the single coed bathroom across the hall from my room and everyone in the hall could hear it."

##### Alana, public relations sophomore #####

"I haven't met anyone on my floor. They're all weird and introverted, and gross with bathroom etiquette. I can't wait to move out."

##### Natalie, economics sophomore #####

"I left my door unlocked for 5 whole minutes and a guy carrying a blanket (who I have never seen before) walked in, stared at me in the dark, slammed the door and sprinted away."

##### Tori, social work sophomore #####
