## Description ##

San Jacinto, commonly referred to as ‘San Jac,’ is the second newest dormitory on campus. Built in 2000, the large five floor coed dormitory houses 811 students each year. It provides accessible accommodations, movable furniture, private bathrooms and a computer lab. Cypress Bend Cafe sits on the ground floor providing a convenience store, restaurant and sandwich bar for students. The dormitory also has a game room, TV lounge, study lounges on each floor, and an amphitheater in the back. Darrell K Royal Memorial Stadium, Gregory Gym and Clark Field are all within close proximity to San Jacinto.

# Resident Reviews #

> I met one of my closest friends in this dorm on an elevator ride from the first floor to the second.

"Loved living in the dorms. While I miss not having a kitchen and having more space and privacy, I felt like it was well worth it to live on campus. I met my best friends on my floor, including my roommate. It's convenient to have Cypress Bend on the ground floor of my dorm, with JCL close by. San Jac definitely feels like one of the safest and most welcoming dorms too." 

##### Angelo, computer science freshman #####

"I loved living in San Jacinto. It was a dorm full of fun and smart people. I made all of my friends there freshman year, and always had people to eat with, watch movies with, go out with, etc. There were always plenty of places to study and hang out with others, and the building is incredibly designed to last for several years. My only dislike is the size of the rooms, but it's part of the college experience. Definitely live in a dorm with a diversity of students, and go to all of the social events. You will meet other students who are also looking for friends and will meet a variety of people from different majors, cities, and cultures. I live somewhere without much diversity or focus on academics, and I miss my time at San Jacinto because of it."

##### Alena, architecture senior #####

"I met some of my closest friends through the elevator at San Jac. I would just start up a conversation and when I saw that person again in the dorm, we'd recognize each other and say hi. Slowly I built up friendships. I met one of my closest friends in this dorm on an elevator ride from the first floor to the second."

##### Jessica, nursing freshman #####

"Every other night during football season, we were serenaded with endless renditions of Texas Fight from band practice at the stadium. Make sure you and your roommate are compatible, and if you're not, don't be afraid to get a reassignment early in the year. Too many people I knew got paired with random roommates with incompatible habits, and they chose to suffer though the year rather than get a room change."

##### Parker, Plan II/business sophomore #####

"Great! I just wish the walls were a little thicker, the microwave actually heated up food, the water pressure in the sink was higher, and the dryers actually worked."

##### Andrew, chemistry freshman #####

"It's a great community with amazing staff and fun programs. It's clean, looks nice, and the rooms are comfortable. The location is great because it's right next to the stadium and Clark field. We recently had a s'mores event where we roasted marshmallows on the gril outside and watched a movie. It was super fun, and I got to meet a lot of san jac residents. My best experiences at San Jac have been at programs like this that are put on by the resident assistants and the resident hall council."

##### Tara, business freshman #####

"San Jac is one of the best dorms to live in on campus. Although it is one of the more expensive dorms, it is totally worth it. Every room has a private bathroom which is really nice for privacy and convenience and we have a cafe right downstairs for food if you're ever hungry. The lounges are top notch quality and if you live here, you won't hate your life as if you were to live in Jester. San Jac is great for athletes because we are just 3 minutes away from Gregory gym and the Stadium. The level of noise is pretty quiet which is nice and staff is friendly too. There is also a piano in the lounge on the first floor so if you know how to play the piano you can impress some people by doing so. Also, you can control the temperature of your room which is also important. One downfall would be if you are a major in the moody college of communications like me, the location of the dorm is far away from the Belo New Media Center. However, almost any dorm is kind of like that depending on where you want to go. To make up for the distance, the 640 bus stops right in front of san jac to take you to the moody building. Otherwise, really good quality dorm."

##### Sunny, journalism sophomore #####

"I really liked all of the people I met; I made many close friends in San Jac. I loved the formal lounge (it had a grand piano in it), and the food at Cypress is really good. I suppose it would have been nice if there was only one tower instead of two (north and south) because that split the dorm in half and probably cut down on the number of people I could have met. There isn't much I would have liked to know before choosing where to live; I think San Jac was a great choice."

##### Amanda, journalism senior #####

"San Jac is very nice, comfortable, and spacious. Sometimes the noise can pick up, but Cypress Bend is convenient and there are lots of amenities around. Make sure you get involved in your residence hall! They host fun events."

##### Caroline, undeclared freshman #####
