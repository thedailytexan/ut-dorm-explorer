San Jacinto, commonly referred to as ‘San Jac,’ is the second newest dormitory on campus. Built in 2000, the large five floor coed dormitory houses 811 students each year. It provides accessible accommodations, movable furniture, private bathrooms and a computer lab. Cypress Bend Cafe sits on the ground floor providing a convenience store, restaurant and sandwich bar for students. The dormitory also has a game room, TV lounge, study lounges on each floor, and an amphitheater in the back. Darrell K Royal Memorial Stadium, Gregory Gym and Clark Field are all within close proximity to San Jacinto.

##Pros##

> I met one of my closest friends in this dorm on an elevator ride from the first floor to the second.

---

"Loved living in the dorms. While I miss not having a kitchen and having more space and privacy, I felt like it was well worth it to live on campus. I met my best friends on my floor, including my roommate. It's convenient to have Cypress Bend on the ground floor of my dorm, with JCL close by. San Jac definitely feels like one of the safest and most welcoming dorms too." 

#####Angelo, computer science freshman#####

"I loved living in San Jacinto. It was a dorm full of fun and smart people. I made all of my friends there freshman year, and always had people to eat with, watch movies with, go out with, etc. There were always plenty of places to study and hang out with others, and the building is incredibly designed to last for several years. My only dislike is the size of the rooms, but it's part of the college experience."

#####Alena, architecture senior#####

"I met some of my closest friends through the elevator at San Jac. I would just start up a conversation and when I saw that person again in the dorm, we'd recognize each other and say hi. Slowly I built up friendships. I met one of my closest friends in this dorm on an elevator ride from the first floor to the second."

"Great! I just wish the walls were a little thicker, the microwave actually heated up food, the water pressure in the sink was higher, and the dryers actually worked."
