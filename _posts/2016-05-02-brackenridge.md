#Resident Reviews#

> Don't worry about newness of dorms or glamor. That usually will end up being a con rather than a pro.

"After football games, my roommate and I open our windows and throw hook em signs at people going back home while singing The Eyes of Texas. We also dance at the same time. Live in BRP if you want a home-y, ivy league styles dorm!! It's also in really close proximity to JCL, Jesta Pizza, and J2. You're probably closer than people who live in Jester are."

"It was an old dorm and I wouldn't have lived there without needing a dorm when my apartment fell through sophomore year, but it turned out amazingly. Don't worry about newness of dorms or glamor. That usually will end up being a con rather than a pro." 

#####Taylor, advertising senior#####

"Our room is right next to the Jester Center, so my roommate and I will occasionally get woken up by a semi-truck delivering food for J2/JCL at 2 AM. Cypress Bend is the best on-campus dining hall. If you are in Jester, it is worth the extra walk."

#####Ben, computer science freshman#####
