#Resident Reviews#


> Make sure you pay attention to the location of your dorm in comparison to the location of your classes.

"If you enjoy being close to campus, and like waking up late, this is a great idea for your first year. It helps you to get a feel of the campus in a more personal way and lets you get the feel of living on your own, with people doing it right along side of you for the first time."

#####Olivia, psychology sophomore#####


"It is NOT worth the money to live with someone over your shoulder the whole time. You could live with Jesus and you'd still want to murder him by the end of the year. Take a breath, talk to your parents, and get an apartment with your own room. Your sex life and your sanity will be spared and it is without a doubt worth the almost negligible amount of cash."

#####Eleanor, microbiology sophomore#####

"It is conveniently close to the dining hall, but you have to cross Dean Keeton to get pretty much anywhere!"

#####Melissa, psychology senior#####

"Would like more late night dining options for north west side campus dorms. Also, there were not many vegetarian options for students in kin's market."

#####Amulya, psychology sophomore#####

"Make sure to abide by fire safety rules.  Inspections of rooms really do happen regularly and if you get a notice that you're in violation of fire safety there will for sure be a follow up inspection and a threat of getting fined. The dining hall in kinsolving hosted a cultural dinner once where high quality food representing Italian culture, Native American culture, Mexican culture, etc. was served and you could answer trivia questions to win a free T-shirt."

#####Victoria, chemistry freshman#####

"When you share a bathroom between rooms, sometimes several people will throw up in the toilet numerous times and you just gotta remember to clean the toilet after every Friday and Saturday."

#####Kany, IRG sophomore#####

"Choose the dorm that's closest to your college, so if you're in business, COLA, fine arts, try to stay in the Waller Creek area, and if you're communications or architecture, look into staying around Whitis. Waller Creek is where all the excitement happens, but if your classes are near Whitis, you're gonna find yourself hiking up there all the time."

#####Oksana, speech pathology freshman#####
