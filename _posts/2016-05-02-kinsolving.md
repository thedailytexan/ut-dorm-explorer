There are many amenities in Kinsolving, including the Academic Community Center, Kinâ€™s Market (a convenience store), a community garden, a 24-hour desk, a patio and a sun deck. It also has a large buffet style dining hall. The Drag, the communication school, and the Student Services Building are all near Kinsolving.

##Pros##

> Here's a cool short blockquote that sums up good feelings about San Jacinto.

#####Angelo Cioffi, Computer Science Freshman#####

---

"Loved living in the dorms. While I miss not having a kitchen and having more space and privacy, I felt like it was well worth it to live on campus. I met my best friends on my floor, including my roommate. It's convenient to have Cypress Bend on the ground floor of my dorm, with JCL close by. San Jac definitely feels like one of the safest and most welcoming dorms too." 

#####Angelo Cioffi, Computer Science Freshman#####

"I loved living in San Jacinto. It was a dorm full of fun and smart people. I made all of my friends there freshman year, and always had people to eat with, watch movies with, go out with, etc. There were always plenty of places to study and hang out with others, and the building is incredibly designed to last for several years. My only dislike is the size of the rooms, but it's part of the college experience."

#####Alena Savera, Architecture Senior#####

"I liked it overall, but I had some problems with the heating and the sink clogs really easily. I liked having the food and market right downstairs, although I did miss being able to cook."

#####Natalie, biomedical engineering freshman#####

##Cons##

> A blockquote from the :( section.

#####Angelo Cioffi, Computer Science Freshman#####

---

"Would like more late night dining options for north west side campus dorms. Also, there were not many vegetarian options for students in kin's market."

#####Amulya, psychology freshman#####

"It is conveniently close to the dining hall, but you have to cross Dean Keeton to get pretty much anywhere!"

#####Melissa, psychology junior#####

"When you share a bathroom between rooms, sometimes several people will throw up in the toilet numerous times and you just gotta remember to clean the toilet after every Friday and Saturday."

#####Kany, international relations freshman#####
