Carothers stands on the west side of the honors quad. The coed dormitory, built in 1937, houses 131 students on three floors. Accessible accommodations are available for students who need them, furniture in each dorm room is movable, and the dorm features community bathrooms as well as a computer lab. Similar to Andrews, Carothers also has individual room climate control. However it also has the University Honors Center and a 24-hour desk. The Drag, the communication school, and Kinsolving Dining Hall are all in close proximity to Carothers.

"I loved it. Great community, great courtyard, great study places. The dorms themselves are pretty average, but I had no serious complaints. I was happy we had a sink." 

#####Ellen, biology and rhetoric senior#####

"The most wonderful quiet place to come home and crash."

#####Jason, government freshman#####

"Here's another quote."

"Great! I just wish the walls were a little thicker, the microwave actually heated up food, the water pressure in the sink was higher, and the dryers actually worked."
