## Description ##

Carothers stands on the west side of the honors quad. The coed dormitory, built in 1937, houses 131 students on three floors. Accessible accommodations are available for students who need them, furniture in each dorm room is movable, and the dorm features community bathrooms as well as a computer lab. Similar to Andrews, Carothers also has individual room climate control. However it also has the University Honors Center and a 24-hour desk. The Drag, the communication school, and Kinsolving Dining Hall are all in close proximity to Carothers.

Andrews, Blanton, Carothers and Littlefield are part of the Honors Living Community (also known as "The Quad"), which is open only to Honors Students and their chosen roommates.

> I was happy we had a sink.

"The most wonderful quiet place to come home and crash."

##### Jason, government sophomore #####

"I loved it. Great community, great courtyard, great study places. The dorms themselves are pretty average, but I had no serious complaints. I was happy we had a sink." 

##### Ellen, biology and rhetoric senior #####

"My favorite thing so far about the Honors Quad has been hanging out with people on the Blanton Sundeck. One time, we talked until 4 in the morning about everything while listening to good music and eating cookies one of my friend's mom had sent. It was a good time. If you're stuck between rooming with someone you know and someone you don't, don't be afraid to room with the latter. Rooming with someone relatively unknown can help you expand your social circle. At the very least, you'll get practice interacting with new people. Plus, you might end up disliking the person you knew well when you become roommates."

##### Jay, Plan II/business freshman #####

"Dorms are way too expensive, UT asks too much for how little they offer. Some dorms are just too old and creepy, and others don't even have elevators. Very little has been done to improve the overall look of most dorms and the amenities they offer to students. No wonder why people move out right after their freshman year."

##### Castiel, computer science sophomore #####

"Dorm's are a great way to get adjusted to college, since everything's so close."

##### Aaron, biology freshman #####
