Blanton makes up the east side of the honors quad. It connects with Andrews, however Blanton was built in 1954 (18 years after Andrews’ construction). The coed residence hall holds 274 students spread out on five floors. Each room features movable furniture, and community bathrooms are placed throughout the dormitory. As a part of the honors quad residents are able to take use the quad space freely, as well as enjoy the dorm’s sun deck. The Drag, the communication school, and Kinsolving Dining Hall are all in close proximity to Blanton.

##Pros##

> I really like the Honors Quad community - I'll be staying in the Quad again next year in part due to it.

"I loved living in San Jacinto. It was a dorm full of fun and smart people. I made all of my friends there freshman year, and always had people to eat with, watch movies with, go out with, etc. There were always plenty of places to study and hang out with others, and the building is incredibly designed to last for several years. My only dislike is the size of the rooms, but it's part of the college experience."

"I really like the Honors Quad community - I'll be staying in the Quad again next year in part due to it. As weird as it may seem to a lot of people, my lack of a sink doesn't even really bother me. The Blanton washing machines and clothes dryers aren't too great, though."

"The rooms were small and had no sinks. The honors community made up for it. "

#####Hasan Syed, Plan II Freshman#####

"Great! I just wish the walls were a little thicker, the microwave actually heated up food, the water pressure in the sink was higher, and the dryers actually worked."

"Living in the dorms that are typically considered far (I also lived in Kinsolving) is like one of the best decisions because it forces you to exercise (no freshman 15!) but also super close to the drag for food!"
