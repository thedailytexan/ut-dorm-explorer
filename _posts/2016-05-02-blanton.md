##History##

Blanton makes up the east side of the honors quad. It connects with Andrews, however Blanton was built in 1954 (18 years after Andrews’ construction). The coed residence hall holds 274 students spread out on five floors. Each room features movable furniture, and community bathrooms are placed throughout the dormitory. As a part of the honors quad residents are able to take use the quad space freely, as well as enjoy the dorm’s sun deck. The Drag, the communication school, and Kinsolving Dining Hall are all in close proximity to Blanton.

#Student Reviews#

> Notable experiences include: creating a giant human sized chess board, hosting a wedding for a resident's two fish, and having a massive 'sleep-over.'

"Living in the dorms that are typically considered far (I also lived in Kinsolving) is like one of the best decisions because it forces you to exercise (no freshman 15!) but also super close to the drag for food!"

#####Arushii, neuroscience sophomore#####

"As an RA, I have to handle a lot of serious situations in the dorms. Because of that, I really love seeing the whimsical fun filled room (called the Blobby) where people from all over the Honor's Quad study, hand out, and find the weirdest ways to relax. Some notable experiences include: creating a giant human sized chess board, hosting a wedding for a resident's two fish, and having a massive "sleep-over." It's great to see residents connect and have fun while simultaneously starting out of trouble."

#####Austin, economics/government sophomore#####

"Try to plan with your roommate what you two will bring as space is at a premium. Try not to bring unnecessary items as it's easy for a small room to look cluttered."

#####Nicky, IRG freshman#####

"I really like the Honors Quad community - I'll be staying in the Quad again next year in part due to it. As weird as it may seem to a lot of people, my lack of a sink doesn't even really bother me. The Blanton washing machines and clothes dryers aren't too great, though." 

#####Griffin Glenn, Plan II/physics sophomore#####

"The rooms were small and had no sinks. The honors community made up for it."

#####Hasan Syed, Plan II sophomore#####
