Jester East plays second fiddle to Jester West in terms of size, but not in newness. It hosts 1,148 students living on 10 floors. The Jester dorm complex was built in 1969, and is so large that it once had its own zip code. All of the eastern coed dorm was renovated to include movable furniture, private and connecting bathrooms, a computer lab and accessible accommodations.

##Pros##

> Jester, due to its size, housed every personality and allowed me to interact with so many people.

---

"I liked how close Jester East is to campus, dining halls, and multiple bus stops to get you around the city. Being able to have a Wendy's, Freshen's, Starbucks and two dining halls right down stairs was a blessing and a curse (mainly a blessing, though). I also liked the modern feel of the lobby. I enjoyed studying there during the day and listening to somebody playing the piano right behind me. Overall, living in Jester East was fabulous."

#####Sierra, business freshman#####

"I wanted the full college experience coming in to freshman year, so I went for the biggest dorm on campus. I've heard so many people talk poorly of Jester but I loved every minute of my time there. The convenience of the location and (more importantly) the dining options were great, but my favorite part of my freshman year experience were the people I met. Jester, due to its size, housed every personality and allowed me to interact with so many people. I know other dorms have certain reputations regarding personality, but I loved that Jester was such a mix. I met my very best friends on the 3rd floor of Jester East, and I wouldn't have traded my year there for anything." 

#####Kathleen, corporate communications junior#####

"It was great! awesome way to make friends and it was very convenient/close to all my classes... and food."

##Cons##

> For what you are paying the rooms are not in good condition.

---

"The location as well as the amenities in the lobby make Jester East very convenient, however as a whole it is not worth the money. The building tends to be loud at night, for what you are paying the rooms are not in good condition (e.g. there is piping on the walls carrying electrical wires) and and the rules there make the place very irritating. On occasion there will be a large group of people having an event in the courtyard area and will play extremely loud music until very late that you can clearly hear inside."

#####Bradley, aerospace engineering freshman#####

"Great! I just wish the walls were a little thicker, the microwave actually heated up food, the water pressure in the sink was higher, and the dryers actually worked."
