Littlefield is the smaller of the female-only dormitories at UT. Built in 1927, it is also the oldest. The dormitory stands on the north side of the honors quad, is made up of three floors and holds 152 women. It features movable furniture and community bathrooms. Hand painted ceiling beams and a fireplace are only some of the nice architectural touches in the historical dorm that can only be appreciated from within. Littlefield Patio Cafe sits next to the dorm, allowing easy access to food for hungry students. The Drag, the communication school, and Kinsolving Dining Hall are all in close proximity to Littlefield.

##Pros##

> Here's a cool short blockquote that sums up good feelings about San Jacinto.

#####Angelo Cioffi, Computer Science Freshman#####

"Littlefield was very tiny but quaint. It felt 'homey' even though it was a little cramped. We even figured out a way to unbunk our beds by stacking shelves on top of other furniture. However, because it is very small and the walls are thin, we got quite a few noise complaints....on the weekend. It's an honors dorm, so we guessed people were trying to study. So, I don't recommend it if you like to party on weekends! Also, there are shared hall bathrooms. It is nice that your washer/dryer are on the same floor though." 

#####Caroline, civil engineering senior#####

"Littlefield is a veery quiet dorm. If you want to make friends in your hall, you should not live there. But the rooms are pretty; I liked the calming, green accent wall they each have. The advantage to the not very friendly/outgoing vibe is that the Littlefield Living room is often a great, quiet place to study."

"Great! I just wish the walls were a little thicker, the microwave actually heated up food, the water pressure in the sink was higher, and the dryers actually worked."
