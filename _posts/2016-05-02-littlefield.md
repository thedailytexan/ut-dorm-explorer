## Description ##

Littlefield is the smaller of the female-only dormitories at UT. Built in 1927, it is also the oldest. The dormitory stands on the north side of the honors quad, is made up of three floors and holds 152 women. It features movable furniture and community bathrooms. Hand painted ceiling beams and a fireplace are only some of the nice architectural touches in the historical dorm that can only be appreciated from within. Littlefield Patio Cafe sits next to the dorm, allowing easy access to food for hungry students. The Drag, the communication school, and Kinsolving Dining Hall are all in close proximity to Littlefield.

*Andrews, Blanton, Carothers and Littlefield are part of the Honors Living Community (also known as "The Quad"), which is open only to Honors Students and their chosen roommates.*

# Resident Reviews #

> There were ladybugs flying around in my room, which is ironic because the hall's mascot is the ladybug.

"Littlefield was very tiny but quaint. It felt 'homey' even though it was a little cramped. We even figured out a way to unbunk our beds by stacking shelves on top of other furniture. However, because it is very small and the walls are thin, we got quite a few noise complaints....on the weekend. It's an honors dorm, so we guessed people were trying to study. So, I don't recommend it if you like to party on weekends! Also, there are shared hall bathrooms. It is nice that your washer/dryer are on the same floor though." 

##### Caroline, civil engineering senior #####

"Littlefield is a very quiet dorm. If you want to make friends in your hall, you should not live there. But the rooms are pretty; I liked the calming, green accent wall they each have. The advantage to the not very friendly/outgoing vibe is that the Littlefield Living room is often a great, quiet place to study."

##### Chelsea, psychology sophomore #####

"It's a good choice if you want to be somewhere close, but they are way more expensive than an apartment."

##### Katherine, economics sophomore #####

"The RA's and activity staff at Littlefield thought we were no more than 16 year old girls, and threw dumb parties like 'sweet 16' and bachelorette parties that nobody showed up to. It was quite sad to live there and see the failed activities. I also felt like I was constantly talked down to and treated like a child. The other girls who lived there also acted like they were in high school still, all were very immature among other things. I didn't enjoy my time there."

##### Sarah, history junior #####

"There was a bus stop right outside my window, and since the buses naturally make a lot of noise on the road, and make a lot of noise when they stop and open/close the doors (plus the recorded voice that announces the stop), I never needed an alarm clock. The bus woke me up every 20 minutes."

##### Joyce, biochemistry junior #####

"Littlefield is isolated from the rest of the quad, and it's sad. Littlefield girls do not have ID access to the other dorms in the quad. Littlefield traditions seemed made for a time in the '50s when people were more easily entertained. I wish that I had either lived in ABC, where my friends were, or actually made friends with people in Littlefield. Ask a current resident about the community. Room size and bathrooms don't matter as much as you think they do."

##### Elizabeth, English and Latin junior #####
