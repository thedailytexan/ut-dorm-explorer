Welcome to the Git repository for *The Daily Texan*'s Residence Halls Explorer.

This project is fully open-sourced, and will remain open source as we make additions and modifications. It is maintained by Junyuan Tan and Arjun Talpallikar, along with the other technical operations staff of the Texan.

The explorer is built with Jekyll, a Ruby-based static site generator. AngularJS and Mapbox GL-JS were used in the front end to provide data filtering and map work. The project must compile into static HTML and static files in order to be hosted on the DT servers. 

Dependencies: `gem install jekyll-angular, gem install octopress-autoprefixer`
